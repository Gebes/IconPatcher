<h1 align="center">macOS Icon Patcher</h1>

## ðŸ”¥ About the project

[macosicons.com](https://macosicons.com/#/) is an excellent source of custom App icons. However, there is a small problem. Every time certain Apps update (e. g. Jetbrains IDEs), the Icon resets to the old one, and it is tedious to set them manually back. With this tool, you have a powerful way to configure Icon patches.

## ðŸ›  How to use

1. Clone the project
2. Install the tool with
```bash
go install ./cmd/icon-patcher
```
3. Use the tool `icon-patcher` in the CLI and provide a [configuration file](https://github.com/Gebes/IconPatcher/blob/main/examples/config.yaml)
